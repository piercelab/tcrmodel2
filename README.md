## TCRmodel2
To model TCR-pMHC complex structures, as well as unbound TCR structures, with high fidelity. 

While you have the option to download and install TCRmodel2 locally, we recommend utilizing our web server for generating predictions. The web server offers a user-friendly interface and eliminates the need for local installation. You can access the web server at the following URL:

## Quick start
The TCRmodel2 code is adapted from AlphaFold v.2.3.0. 

First, clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/piercelab/tcrmodel2
cd tcrmodel2
``` 

### Requirements
NVIDIA CUDA driver >= 11.2

### Download database
While the majority of database files can be found in `data/databases/` folder, due to file size limit, one would need to: 
1. unzip pdb sequence database file:
```bash
cd data/databases
tar -xvzf pdb_seqres.txt.tar.gz
```
2. download pdb_mmcif and params database (around 120 GB total after unzip) used by alphafold to a database folder of your choice, the path of which will be pass as a ori_db variable to the run_tcrmodel2.py and run_tcrmodel2_ub_tcr.py script. Please refer to the download instructions in [download_pdb_mmcif.sh](https://github.com/deepmind/alphafold/blob/18e12d61314214c51ca266d192aad3cc6619018a/scripts/download_pdb_mmcif.sh) and [download_alphafold_params.sh](https://github.com/deepmind/alphafold/blob/6a3af1adb3bbbc53562da100e3819b2fc882f915/scripts/download_alphafold_params.sh) in [alphafold](https://github.com/deepmind/alphafold/) repository. 

### Install Software

To get started with using TCRmodel2, you have two options for installation:


#### Option 1: Build Singularity Container 

This project can be set up using Singularity, which allows you to create and run containers. 

1. Ensure you have Singularity installed on your system. If not, download and install it from the [Singularity official website](https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/latest/user-guide/).

2. We provide two singularity definition files (*.def) in the `singularity` directory, representing two different CUDA versions. You can copy the one corresponding to your CUDA version (or a similar version) to `singularity/tcrmodel2_singularity.def`, making additional modificiations as needed to match your system's specific CUDA, etc. configuration.

3. Build the Singularity container. We offer a pre-built Singularity image file that is compatible with CUDA version 11.2, which you can access [here](https://piercelab.ibbr.umd.edu/alphafold_tcrmodel_test_cuda112_tfgpu.sif). Please right-click the link and choose 'Save Link As...' to save the file. However, for greater flexibility and compatibility with the CUDA version on your machine, we recommend building the .sif file from the provided .def file. This approach allows you to tailor the build to your specific system requirements.

   ```bash
   sudo singularity build tcrmodel2.sif singularity/tcrmodel2_singularity.def
   ```

If you do not have sudo permission, you may build with the following command instead:

   ```bash
   singularity build --fakeroot tcrmodel2.sif singularity/tcrmodel2_singularity.def
   ```

2. Run the Singularity container. Example usage can be found in `singularity/run_tcrmodel2_singularity.sh`. Update variables like `ALPHAFOLD_DB`, `ALPHAFOLD_SIF`, `OUTPUT_DIR`, and elements such as `job_id` and input sequences `tcra_sequence`, `tcrb_seq`, `pep_seq`, `mhca_seq` with the appropriate values for your run. For details on how to construct predictions, please refer to sections [Generate TCR-pMHC complex predictions](#generate-tcr-pmhc-complex-predictions) and [Generate unbound TCR predictions](#generate-unbound-tcr-predictions).

#### Option 2: Step-by-Step Installation

For a manual setup, follow these steps:

1. Install AlphaFold requirements in a conda environment. Here's a useful resource if you prefer to install AlphaFold without Docker: https://github.com/kalininalab/alphafold_non_docker 

2. Install additional packages: [ANARCI](https://github.com/oxpig/ANARCI) and [MDAnalysis](https://www.mdanalysis.org/pages/installation_quick_start/) to the conda environment created from previous step. These two packages are not required for generating structural predictions. ANARCI is used to trim TCR to variable domains only, and for renumbering PDB outputs. MDAnalysis is used for output renumbering and output alignment.

    ``` bash
    conda install -c bioconda anarci
    conda config --add channels conda-forge
    conda install mdanalysis
    ``` 

## Generate TCR-pMHC complex predictions
Workflow for creating TCR-pMHC complex structure predictions:
1. Receive TCR alpha, beta, peptide, MHC sequences
2. Build pMHC template alignment file
3. Generate MSA features using a reduced database for all chains, considered seperatedly
4. Generate all other features by concatenating peptide MHC into one chain
5. Predict structures
6. Output 5 structures and a text file containing 1) templates used 2) prediction scores 

Peptide length requirement:
* For class I TCR-pMHC complexes, kindly ensure that the peptide length is between 8-15.
* For class II TCR-pMHC complexes, kindly ensure that the peptide input is 11 aa in length. Specifically, it should consist of a 9 aa core with an additional 1 aa at both the N-terminal and C-terminal of the core peptide.

To make a class I TCR-pMHC prediction:
``` bash
python run_tcrmodel2.py \
--job_id=test_clsI_6kzw \
--output_dir=experiments/ \
--tcra_seq=AQEVTQIPAALSVPEGENLVLNCSFTDSAIYNLQWFRQDPGKGLTSLLLIQSSQREQTSGRLNASLDKSSGRSTLYIAASQPGDSATYLCAVTNQAGTALIFGKGTTLSVSS \

You may use additional flags in run_tcrmodel2.py to control additional behaviors of the script. To see a list of flags:
``` bash
python run_tcrmodel2.py --help
```

## Generate unbound TCR predictions
Workflow for creating TCR-pMHC complex structure predictions:
1. Receive TCR alpha, beta sequences
2. Generate MSA features using reduced database, and modified TCR template search protocol. 
3. Predict structures
4. Output 5 structures and a text file containing 1) templates used 2) prediction scores 

To make a unbound TCR prediction:
``` bash
python run_tcrmodel2_ub_tcr.py \
--job_id=test_tcr_7t2b \
--output_dir=experiments \
--tcra_seq=SQQGEEDPQALSIQEGENATMNCSYKTSINNLQWYRQNSGRGLVHLILIRSNEREKHSGRLRVTLDTSKKSSSLLITASRAADTASYFCATDKKGGATNKLIFGTGTLLAVQP \
